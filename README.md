The Problem
Rapid Arctic climate change is expected to increase tundra fire frequency, intensity and extent over upcoming decades. 
Wildfires are one of the most critical disturbances across Arctic tundra regions as they contribute to thawing of frozen (permafrost) ground, vegetation and landscape change, and ancient carbon release. Arctic wildfires abruptly perturb regional carbon cycling modifying the micro-topography of the landscape, altering local hydrology and patterns of evaporation. 

Lake surface areas reﬂect the balance between rates of surface inﬂow, groundwater discharge, and precipitation falling directly onto a lake, with rates of water loss though surface outﬂow, groundwater recharge, and evaporation/evapotranspiration from the lake surface and surrounding landscape (Anderson et al. 2013). 

Application Example

The 2015 season was a 



Rural community water systems in Puerto Rico without internet acccess can use a mesh network mobile software to send phtots of data logs from drinking water treatment plants to their collaborators who will verify that the water is meeting quality standards.

Sample Data
